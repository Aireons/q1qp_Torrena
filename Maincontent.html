            On the left of this paragraph you can see the table on the relationship between a student and their parents ranging from very good being the highest and very bad being the lowest.
            On the table it shows that a vast majority of students have a good relationship with their parents with only a very small amount having a bad to very bad relationship with their parents.
            We can conclude from this table that more students love their parents than dislike them.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Main">
        <div style="float: right;">
            <img src="Academics graph.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 400px;">
        </div >
            <p>
                On the table on the right we can see a table of the grades we collected from the 50 students with a range of 1.15 to 1.2.
                A majority of the students having exemplary grades some have good grades and a small amount of the students have outstanding grades the rest have adequate grades.
                We can conclude from this table many students have above average grades
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion.</h5>
            <p>From looking at both tables you can see that a majority have good grades and relationship with their parents but these can be just coincidences.
                So i conclude that their is only some correlation between the two as good parents can still be a leading cause of a student wanting to work hard for good grades
